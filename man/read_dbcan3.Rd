\usage{
read_dbcan(dbcan_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{dbcan_path}{a path where dbCAN output data are. They
should have the extension overview.txt and all files in the path are the ones that
need to be read. Output data should have 6 columns with the bin names

column 'Signalp' indcating if a Peptide signal is found and a column
'#ofTools" indicating the number of algorithms that found this Gene.}

\details{
This function is part of a package used for the analysis
