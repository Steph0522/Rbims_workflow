\title{Read the output of dbCAN}
\usage{
read_dbcan(dbcan_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{dbcan_path}{a path where dbCAN output data are. They
should have the extension overview.txt and all files in the path are the ones that
need to be read. Output data should have 6 columns with the bin names
followed by the Genes obtained in every algorithm (HMMER,Hotpep,DIAMOND),
column 'Signalp' indcating if a Peptide signal is found and a column
'#ofTools" indicating the number of algorithms that found this Gene.}

\item{write}{logical. If TRUE then the dataframe generated will be saved in
the directory you are currently working}
}
\description{
read_dbcan3 calculates the abundance of each Gene within the
bins based on the dbCAN output from run_dbcan3 V3.0.6.
