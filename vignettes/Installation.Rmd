## Quick install

We are actively developing rbims, so for now it is not available at CRAN or Bioconductor, however you can access the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/mirnavazquez/RbiMs) like this:

Install devtools in the case you dont have it.

```{r install devtools, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
```

If you are in a MAC system, you would need to download [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/), you can read more about it [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38952427/include-cairo-r-on-a-mac). 

Install rbims.

```{r install rbims, eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("mirnavazquez/RbiMs")
library(rbims)
```
